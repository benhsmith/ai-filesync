# **Step-by-Step Blueprint**

## **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
1. **Basic Argument Parsing**
   - Use `argparse` to define required arguments (`src`, `dest`, `output`).
   - Implement `--help` with usage instructions.
   - Add unit tests to ensure argument parsing behaves correctly.

2. **Directory Scanning**
   - Implement a function to recursively scan `src` and `dest`, collecting file paths.
   - Use `os.walk()` for traversal.
   - Ensure paths are stored in a way that supports relative output.

3. **File Comparison Logic**
   - Implement filename and size-based comparison.
   - Store results in a structured format (e.g., dictionary or set).
   - Add unit tests for different directory structures.

## **Phase 2: Feature Expansion**
4. **MD5 Hashing Support**
   - Implement an MD5 checksum function.
   - Add `--skip-hash` flag to toggle between hashing and non-hashing mode.
   - Optimize hashing by reading files in chunks.
   - Unit test hashing functionality.

5. **File Extension Filtering**
   - Implement `-e, --ext` flag to filter files by extension.
   - Ensure case-insensitive matching.
   - Test scenarios with and without extensions.

6. **Output File Handling**
   - Implement writing missing files to the output file.
   - Ensure output is relative to `src`.
   - Add tests to verify correct output formatting.

## **Phase 3: Optimization and Robustness**
7. **Multithreading for Performance**
   - Implement a threaded scanner for faster processing.
   - Introduce `--threads` flag to control thread count.
   - Test with large directories to validate speed improvements.

8. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Implement structured error handling for:
     - Permission errors
     - Missing directories
     - Inaccessible files
   - Add `--verbose` logging for debugging.
   - Unit test error scenarios.

9. **Progress Reporting**
   - Implement `--progress <N>` to print updates every `N` files.
   - Ensure it doesn't interfere with logging or output.

## **Phase 4: Final Refinements**
10. **Excluding Directories**
    - Implement `--exclude <dir>` to skip unwanted subdirectories.
    - Validate exclusion logic with unit tests.

11. **Symbolic Links Support**
    - Implement `--follow-symlinks` option.
    - Test with different symlink configurations.

12. **Final Testing & Integration**
    - Run tests on various directory structures.
    - Ensure clean output and correct exit codes.
    - Validate performance optimizations.

# **Code Generation Prompts**
Each prompt builds iteratively, ensuring test-driven development.

---

## **Prompt 1: Argument Parsing**
```text
Write a Python script that uses argparse to define the following command-line arguments:

- `src` (required): Source directory.
- `dest` (required): Destination directory.
- `-o, --output <file>` (required): Output file for missing file paths.
- `-e, --ext <ext> ...`: List of file extensions to consider.
- `--skip-hash`: Boolean flag to skip hashing.
- `--follow-symlinks`: Boolean flag to follow symlinks.
- `--threads <N>`: Number of threads for scanning.
- `--progress <N>`: Show progress every N files.
- `--exclude <dir> ...`: List of subdirectories to exclude.
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging.

Ensure that:
- `--help` displays usage instructions.
- Invalid inputs return appropriate error messages.
- Write unit tests for argument parsing.
```

---

## **Prompt 2: Directory Scanning**
```text
Extend the script to scan `src` and `dest` directories recursively using `os.walk()`. 

Requirements:
- Collect file paths and store them in a structured format.
- Paths should be relative to `src` for correct output formatting.
- Ensure the function is efficient and handles large directories.

Write unit tests to verify:
- Correct traversal of nested directories.
- Handling of hidden files.
- Proper relative path conversion.
```

---

## **Prompt 3: File Comparison (Name & Size)**
```text
Implement a function to compare files in `src` and `dest` based on:
- Filename
- File size

Requirements:
- Store results in a dictionary or set for efficient lookup.
- Identify files missing from `dest`.
- Exclude files that exist with the same name and size.

Write unit tests to verify:
- Correctly detects missing files.
- Handles different file structures.
- Works with large file lists.
```

---

## **Prompt 4: MD5 Hashing (Optional)**
```text
Extend the file comparison logic to include an MD5 hash check. 

Requirements:
- Implement an efficient MD5 hashing function.
- Use `--skip-hash` flag to enable/disable hashing.
- Optimize hashing by reading files in chunks (e.g., 64KB per read).
- Write unit tests for hashing function.

Ensure that:
- Hashing correctly detects file differences.
- Performance is optimized for large files.
```

---

## **Prompt 5: Writing Missing Files to Output**
```text
Implement functionality to write the list of missing files to the specified output file.

Requirements:
- Use relative paths (relative to `src`).
- Overwrite existing output file.
- Ensure proper newline formatting.

Write unit tests to verify:
- Correct output formatting.
- Handles empty missing file lists gracefully.
```

## **Prompt 6: Multithreading**
```text
Optimize the scanning process using multithreading.

Write tests to verify:
- Errors are handled gracefully.
- Logging produces expected outputs.

## **Prompt 8: Progress Reporting**
```text
